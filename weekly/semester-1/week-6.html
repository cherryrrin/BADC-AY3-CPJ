RPO peer review and feedbacks forced me to rethink how I communicate my research through concrete examples and simpler language.

              <h2>RPO Peer Review: Reality Check</h2>
              <p class="divider-top">This week we had RPO peer review sessions and individual consultations. The feedback was valuable and I realized that my writing is too complex and inaccessible.</p>
              <h4>Key feedback themes:</h4>
              <div class="black__text-container"> 
                <h6>Make it simple and straightforward.</h6>
               <p> I'm using too much terminology that readers might not understand. Need to provide examples and simpler terms. </p> 
                <h6>Not about topic, but about research.</h6>
                <p> I tend to emphasize introducing the topic (IxD, branding) rather than introducing what I'm actually investigating. Readers should understand my research, not just the field.</p>
                <h6>Finding the middle point.</h6>
                <p>My writing swings between too general and too specific. Need clearer articulation without narrowing the scope too much.</p>
              </div>
              <p>I also read about seven other students' RPOs and realized mine lacks simplicity and engaging moments. Most peer comments didn't target the core of my research, which means they didn't fully understand my writing. That's my problem, not theirs.</p>
              <img class="zoom" src="/assets/images/test.jpg" alt=""><figcaption><p>Peer review paper</p></figcaption>
              <p>One comment suggested case studies would be more suitable than computation for my research, which shows they misunderstood my approach. My research objectives and methods sections weren't structured clearly enough to convey that computation IS the one of the core methods, not just a peripheral tool. This feedback stung a bit, but it's exactly what I needed to hear.</p>  
            </div>

            <div id="section2" class="row width__s margin__auto padding__top-xl">
              <h2>Making It Accessible: <br>Examples and Physical Materials</h2>
              <p class="divider-top">To make my research more engaging and accessible, <br> I started developing concrete examples.</p>

              <div class="margin__left-l">
                <h3>What is branded interaction?</h3>
                <p>The Apple packaging example I created for my moodboard worked well. People understood it immediately. The precisely calibrated resistance when opening an Apple box, timed to feel luxurious rather than cheap or frustrating. This translates the abstract concept of "interaction carrying brand identity" into something tangible. I'm integrating this into my introduction and creating prints of it for my workspace.</p>

                <h3 class="padding__top-l">Why does interaction design <br> matter for brand experience?</h3>
                <div class="row">
                  <div class="column white__text-container">
                    <p><b>Bad interaction design is like a rude waiter:</b></p> <p>
                      Imagine entering a restaurant and the waiter immediately bombards you: "Hi, what's your name? Age? Email? Can you prove it? What's your preference? Password?" <br><br>You'd feel overwhelmed. You'd think they're rude. You wouldn't want to return.
                    </p>
                  </div>
                  <div class="column white__text-container">
                    <p><b>Good interaction design is like a welcoming cafe:</b></p>
                    <p> You enter. The space is cosy. With Jazz music, grinding sound is nice and subtle. You smell coffee and bread. Baristas look professional and greet you with a smile. Now you feel the cafe's identity. <br><br> You start loving the place. You want to visit again.</p>
                  </div>
                </div>

                <h6 class="padding__top-m"><p>Why not the same attention in apps and websites where people spend their whole day?</p></h6> <p>This analogy (adapted from  
                 <a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/KWtWqbJSP5E?si=SzOCY3iwb8LaxSq4" >Jamal Nichols's "What is Interaction Design"</a>) makes the concept immediately understandable without requiring knowledge of HCI theory.</p>

                 <h3 class="padding__top-l">Korean Vocabulary: 감성, 분위기, 느낌</h3>
                 <p>While thinking about "atmospheric branding," I realized Koreans have specific words for this that we use constantly, and even have a trending slang(느좋) for it:</p>
                 <div class="orange__text-container">
                  <ul class="bulletpoints">
                    <li> <p>감성적인/있는 (gam-seong) - has sensibility/emotion</p></li>
                    <li><p>분위기 좋은/있는 (bun-wi-gi) - has good atmosphere</p></li>
                    <li><p>느낌 좋은 (neu-ggim jo-eun / 느좋) - feels good</p></li>
                  </ul>
                 </div>

                 <p class="padding__top-m">We use above words unconsciously to describe nicely designed things. But we don't consciously think "this has emotion" in a literal sense. If you asked me to translate directly to English, I wouldn't say "it has emotion" or "it has feeling" or "it has atmosphere", which just sounds weird. </p>
                <p>Maybe closer to English "vibe"? Like "this has good vibes" or "the vibe is right." This is worth exploring more. These Korean concepts might offer a more accessible way to discuss atmospheric branding than heavy theoretical terms like "Böhme's atmospheric aesthetics." People already use these words naturally to describe designed experiences.</p>
