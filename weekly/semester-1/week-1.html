                <h2>Initial Project Concepts</h2>
                <p>
                  Last year of undergrad. Year-long project. Kind of terrifying, kind of exciting.
                  <br><br>My research question right now: How can interactions be branded? How can micro-interactions, motion design, and feedback systems embody a brand's personality beyond just functional purposes?
 
                  <br> <br>The hypothesis I'm working with: in our screen-dominated world, interfaces have become where brands establish emotional connections. Every swipe, scroll, tap—these aren't just usability decisions. They're fundamental components of brand identity.But right now that's still pretty abstract. I need to figure out what this actually means in practice.

                  Reflecting on my journey, it's funny how my relationship with computation has evolved. In Year 1, I was honestly reluctant about coding because it just felt overwhelming. But that initial struggle brought me here. Just like the meme below that I found from Code academy forum.

                  There's something addictive about the troubleshooting process: the frustration, the breakthrough moments, and finally seeing your intended vision come to life through code. This shows my broader design evolution and formed one of the many reasons why I got into Computation in Design.

                <h3>From Drawing To Here</h3>
                <p>
                  My design path began from fine art and drawing. The transition happened through Photoshop, documenting my artwork, which opened the door to digital design. What drew me to branding initially was the directness: unlike the complex meanings in fine art, digital branding allowed immediate iteration and clear visual results.

                  <p>My internship at LTA's IT department has been valuable but also frustrating.Working alongside software engineers and data engineers highlighted a massive communication gap: it's really hard to explain sophisticated interaction design through traditional tools like Figma prototypes.</p>

                  <h3>Recent Inspirations</h3>

                  <p> Apple's approach to holistic brand embodiment is the north star here. Their design philosophy goes way beyond visual elements: Sophisticated haptic feedback that feels premium Carefully timed animations and transitions Sound design that feels inherently "Apple"Even packaging experiences—that precisely calculated unboxing timing that creates premium excitement without feeling rushed</p>

                <div class="column">
                  <h3></h3>
                  <p>
                    The unboxing thing is wild when you think about it. They engineer the SPEED of opening a box. Not too fast (feels cheap), not too slow (frustrating). Just slow enough to feel luxurious and create anticipation. At that moment you forget how expensive their products actually are. (Kapferer talks about this, pp.126-127) This attention to temporal and sensory details shows how branding can be truly embodied through interaction design, not just visual identity.
