              <h2>Getting Unstuck from Theory Mode</h2>
              <h3 class="divider-top">Critical journal workshop with Shu Min:</h3>

               <p>This week began with a valuable workshop on critical journaling methodology. Learning the fundamentals of what to write, how to structure critical reflection, and seeing concrete examples helped refine my approach to this documentation process. Turns out I've been overthinking it. </p>

                <img class="orange-border zoom" src="/assets/images/CriticalJournal Seminar_Research Plan.jpg" alt=""> <figcaption><p>Research Plan - Critical Journal Framework</p></figcaption>
                
                <p>The most impactful exercise was developing practical research plans. This forced me to translate my theoretical interests into concrete, actionable steps. The mind mapping process (see diagram below) helped visualize my research components.</p>

                <h3>Atelier Exercise: <br> Mind Map & Peer Feedback</h3>

                <img class="orange-border zoom " src="/assets/images/week-3_mindmap.jpg" alt="">
                <figcaption><p>Mindmap exercise and stickers</p></figcaption>
                
                <p> We put our research mind maps on the table and everyone walked around putting stickers on parts that interested them. I was expecting people to get excited about my core research stuff, but... they didn't (obviously). Most stickers ended up on random words that were respectively interesting but weren't the core of my research. <br><br>At first I was kind of bummed but then I realized the problem: I was using all these fancy academic terms that probably sounded like gibberish to people who haven't been reading the same books as me. "Materiality of interaction" and "Atmospheric Aesthetics" - I mean, what does that even mean to a normal person? <br><br> It sounds like academic gibberish. Which it kind of is if you can't explain it simply. The stickers that DID get attention: "dimension of interaction," "interaction archive." The tangible stuff. The parts where I talked about actually doing something.</p>

                      <p>"Getting started with making might be tough, because you will have to think what you want to make, how, and all these uncertainties. But eventually, it's easy to find yourself just thinking. So if you have difficulty starting, just start, start making, translate your thinking through making. It's fine to stop in the middle, you will get something."</p>

              <h2>Research Progress</h2>
              <p class="divider-top">Before diving into experiments, I need to note some reading progress because it's actually clarifying the "through computation, through making" approach.</p>

              <h3>Böhme's Topos vs Spatium</h3>
                <p> Reading <b>Atmospheric Aesthetics</b> was more difficult at first because it's about architecture, not interfaces. But his distinction between two types of space is actually perfect for what I'm researching:
                </p>

              <div class="black__text-container">
                  <p>
                    <b>Spatium</b> =  geometric space (coordinates on a map, measured dimensions) <br> <b>Topos</b> =</strong> lived space (where you actually ARE, what you feel bodily)
                  </p>
                </div>

                <p>Digital interfaces create topos, spaces where users inhabit and feel, not just geometric layouts they look at. Just like physical rooms can feel overwhelming or comforting, interfaces generate atmospheric experiences users feel bodily. and this is exactly what I mean by "atmospheric branding." It's not about how an interface looks geometrically. It's about how it feels to be in it. </p>


                <h3><b>Löwgren on Sketching in Code</b></h3>

                <div class="white__text-container">
                  <p>
                    <span class="oblique">
                      "For interaction design... when designing innovative interaction techniques, it may be necessary to sketch in software and hardware rather than staying with lo-fi sketching media... the notion of sketching is more about the mindset of the designer than about the medium used." -Jonas Löwgren
                    </span>
                  </p>
                </div>
                <p>This validates my computational approach. So code can be sketching, if I treat it as exploratory and disposable rather than trying to build finished products. This helps me stop overthinking whether my prototypes need to be good enough. "They're sketches."  </p>

               <p> I started by collecting branded interaction examples. Checked out different platforms like UI Movement, Collect UI, Mobbin, Page Flows, 60fps.design, etc. and I found 60fps.design really useful and easy to access, so I decided to invest 82 SGD in the pro version for filters and detailed breakdowns.</p>

              <h4 class="padding__top-l">Key realization while collecting:</h4>  <p> I need to clarify distinctions between <b>motion, animation, and interaction</b>. Otherwise I might accidentally research motion graphics instead of interactions. <b>Motion = visual movement. Animation = timed sequences. Interaction = response to user input.</b> My focus is the last one, interactions, which the other ones can be benifitial for crafting it.</p>
